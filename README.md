Yet another PHP Config API
==========================

Just commiting this code somewhere I can keep it.

I made this code a while ago, I just needed to see it back for some reason.

I won't lie, this is unfinished. The main goal was to plug it on GConf for a
specific PHP application. Still doable, using php-dbus (search DBus in PECL
site). I may do it some day that's something I'd be terribly curious to
benchmark.
